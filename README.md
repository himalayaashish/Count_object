🚀 Object Detection and Visualization with HALCON 👁️
<div align="center"> 🎯 **Object Detection and Visualization with HALCON** </div>
Overview
In this project, I utilized HALCON, a powerful image processing library, to develop an object detection and visualization tool. This project focuses on detecting objects in images, filtering them based on size and shape, and visually highlighting them with customized colors in real-time.

The system works by applying thresholding, connected component analysis, and region selection, followed by real-time visualization of the results. This is an essential technique for industrial automation, quality inspection, and any field requiring automated visual analysis.

🚀 Key Features:
Object Detection: Detect and count objects in images using HALCON.
Region Filtering: Apply area and shape filters to accurately select objects.
Real-Time Visualization: Display the detected objects in a separate window with color-coded highlights for easy identification.
🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python
HALCON (for image processing and object detection)
OpenCV (for image display and additional processing)
🔧 Installation and Setup:
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/halcon-object-detection.git
Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python halcon
Run the Script
Execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python object_detection.py
Visualize the Results
The script will process the image and open a window with the colored highlighted regions (objects) based on your image.

📝 How It Works:
Image Loading: Load an image using HALCON's read_image() function.
Thresholding: Apply a threshold to extract regions of interest.
Connected Components: Find connected regions (objects) in the thresholded image.
Region Filtering: Select regions based on their area and rectangularity.
Visualization: Highlight the selected regions with custom colors in a separate window.
💻 Languages and Tools:
Python
HALCON
OpenCV
